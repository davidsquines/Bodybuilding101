      <h3>My Favorite Exercises</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Back Squats</dt>
        <dd> The Queen of Exercices. This is my favorite exercice to target the quads becuase of the amount of weight I can load per workout session and the results I am able to see during my sets. When preforming this exercises, I like to make sure that I breathe into my stomach to create core stababilty and set my feet apart to a distance that is wider than my shoulder width. I try to imagine that I am bringing the bar down in straight path down to the middle of my feet. My current max weight for this exercise is 365 lbs.<br>

        <dt>Conventional Deadlifts</dt>
        <dd> The King of Exercices. Above all exercises, this is my favorite exercise to preform. This exercise is my second heaviest lift I preform on a regular basis, second to the leg press. I love this exercise because of the heavy weight I can lift. My personal cues for this exercise include imagining lifting the bar in a straight path from the middle of my feet upwards, tightening my lats when starting the workout, and keep my neck nuetral by staring at a fixed point in the lower part of my field of vision. My current max on this exercise is 405 lbs. <br>

        </dd>
        <dt>Bulgarian Split Squats</dt>
        <dd> This is one of those exercises where I hate preforming them, but love them afterwards. They are the most tiring exercise to preform, but they deliver the best pump as compared to other quadricep exercises. I usually preform this exercise once a week and try to focus on the eccentric portion of the exercise to deliver the best pump. <br>

        </dd>
        <dt>Flat Dumbbell Chest Press</dt>
        <dd> This is my favorite exercise to target the chest. While many would say the barbell bench press is the best to grow the chest, I have had better results with the dumbbell variation. With the dumbbell variation, I can feel my chest muscles better and I have had better pumps while using dumbbells. It is also less time consuming than using the barbell. <br>

      <h3>Workout Splits</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>Upper/Lower Split</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This workout split encompasses four days. Each day will place emphasis on the upper or lower portion of the body. The emphasis is broken down further by having each uppper and lower day focus on a specific muscle group. I like to use this workout during my bulking phases. During this workout, I will be primarily focusing on heavy weight with rep ranges in the 2-4 range and 6-8 range.</p>

        <dt>Push/Pull/Legs Split</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The body's muscles can also be split into push and pull muscles. Push and pull refer to the type of movements preformed for the exercises. The push muscles are chest, shoulders, and triceps. The pull muscles are back, biceps,and forearms. Legs have their own day. I like to do this exercise during a bulking or cutting phase. I like to split the training regiment by denoting push and pull days to focus on strength and hypertrophy. </p>

        <dt>Five Day Full-Body Split</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This workout is full body workout. This means that during every workout, every muscle group will targeted. Each day will have at least one to two workouts for each muscle group. Additionally, each day will have a muscle group focus. This workout is great for both cutting and bulking phase. The trade-off for this workout is that it can be very taxing. I only suggest this workout for people who have the time to be in the gym five days a week and have ample time for recovery.</p>
