        <h3>What is bodybuilding?</h3>
        <p>Bodybuilding is the process of developing muscle fibers through the combination of weight training, increased caloric intake, and rest. In basic terms, lift heavy, eat well, and you can have a body that can be sculpted out of rock.</p>

        <p>Bodybuilding is a sport where individuals workout to either look physically better or gain or lose weight. From a scientific standpoint, the goal of bodybuilding is to break muscle fibers in the muscles of the human body. The goal of this process is to rebuild those muscle fibers stronger than before. This is why people appear physically bigger after some time working out.</p>
