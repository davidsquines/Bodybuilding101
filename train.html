      <header class="introduction">
        <p>Understanding how to train is one of the most fundamental skills to have as a bodybuilder. That all starts with having a good plan as your foundation. Before every workout phase I start, I like to plan out how the phase. For me, that plan contains two steps. In this page, I will go over the two steps take to train effectively as well as some tips to benefit your workout plan.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 dir="ltr">Step 1: <u><em>Define your goals</em></u></h2>
        <p>It is useless to plan to a roadtrip if you dont plan a destination. When cooking a meal, you do not know what ingrediants you will need unless you specifically know what you are trying to cook. The same goes with planning your workouts. You will not know how to structure your workouts unles you know what goals you are trying to achieve. To figure out my goals, I like to ask myself questions related to what I want to achieve after my workouts.<br>Those questions include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do I want to gain or lose weight after my workout phase?</li>
          <li>Am I looking to build strength and mass or to build a better looking physique?</li>
          <li>What is going on with the current schedule in my life and how will it affect my goals in bodybuilding?</li>
          <li>Will I still enjoy this workout after a month of doing it?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Answering this questions help me completely formulate my workout plan. The first question helps me decide what workout split to employ. The second question helps me decide how to structure the sets and repetitions for each exercise. The third and fourth question are the most important questions I ask myself. Its important to note that you have a limited amount of energy, no matter what your lifestyle is. Working out takes a signigicant amount of energy used for your day to day tasks. You want to make sure that your workout goals do not take over the other goals you have. Working out should fit in with your goals, and work together with them. Now, onto step two. 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="section1">
        <h2 dir="rtl">Step 2: <u><em>Structuing Your Workout</em></u></h2>
        <p>Now that I have defined my goals, I can start formulating my workouts accordingly. I first start with picking a workout split. This will depend on what my goals are for the workout phase. If I am deciding to go on a bulking phase, I will choose a split like Upper/Lower or Push/Pull. You can checkout some splits <a href="splits.html#splits">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Once I have determined my splits, I then choose the exercises I will use per workout. Typically, I like to choose around five to eight exercises per workout day. This can changing depending on how many days I spend in the gym. If I am spending five days in the gym, I like to have five exercises, and for three to four days, i will have six to eight exercises per workout. For this example, I will show you how I create an Upper/Lower Workout split with goals of strength and mass.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Selecting Exercises</h3> 
          <p>Since strength and mass are my goals for this workout phase, I know that I will need select make sure that each day of my plan will have one to two <u>compound exercises</u> per workout day. In the way I structure my upper/lower workout days, I like to have each upper day focus on either back or chest and each lower day focus on either hamstring and glute or quad focus. Lets say I am choosing exercises for an upper chest focused day. Here is what it would look like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flat Bench Press</li>
            <li>Smith Incline Chest Press</li>
            <li>Lat Machine Pulldown</li>
            <li>Cable Rows</li>
            <li>Barbell Overhead Press</li>
            <li>Barbell Curls</li>
            <li>Zottman Curls</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>The compound exercise I choose for this workout day was the flat bench press. Since it is a chest workout, I included more chest exercises than the other upper body exercises. I also included two more bicep exercises, meaning that this day also places more emphasis on the bicep. Next, I will show how I choose sets and repetitions for each exercises and the weights performed for each set. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Selecting Sets and Repetitions</h3> 
          <p>For my exercises, each exercise will have three to four sets. For the compound movements or the exercises where the weight I am lifting is heavy, I will usually include one to four warm up sets. During these warm up sets, I will work up to the weight I am supposed to be pulling or pushing for that exercise. </p>

          <p>When selecting the weight for each exercise, I like to base the weight around my one rep max for that specific exercise. I like to pick a weight that is from seventy to eighty-five percent of my one rep max of that exercise. I use a tool like a one rep max calculator for finding those specific lbs. Here is an a example of one below. </p>
          <iframe id=sc-one_rep_max_cal width=" 800" height=480 allowtransparency=true src="https://calculator-online.net/one-rep-max-calculator/?res_link=0&weight=10&weight_unit=kg&rep=20" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen title="One Rep Max Calculator Web Application"></iframe>
          <!--Here is another use case of iframe where I include a one rep max calculator run from a different web page. -->
          <p>In the web page, you would enter the weight lifted and the number of repetitions you preform with that weight. The calculator will return the weight you can lift and the number of repetitions you should be able to lift at that weight. I like to use this web page as a basis for figuring out the weight I should be pulling for each exercise. <u>Keep in mind that this is completely subjective. Just becuase the calculator says you should be lifting at that pace does not mean you should follow it.</u> Another good practice is choosing a weight at which after you complete the goal number of reps, you still feel like you can do two to three more reps. <br> With this in mind, I will now show you the sets, reps, and weight I would lift for the upper day chest focus example I did previously.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Flat Bench Press 
              <ul>
                <li>Sets: 4 Warm Up Sets, 4 Working Sets</li>

        <h2>Final Tips</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Make sure you are progressing</dt>
          <dd>You want to make sure you are getting better and stronger as the workout program progresses. This does not only mean you can lift more weight the next week. This could mean that you increase a rep or do one more set, or improve your form. Any type of progress will do. </dd>
          <dt>Track Your Progress</dt>
          <dd>As the weeks progress, it will be easy to forget what numbers you put up. Track your progress in a little notebook. This will help you track your workouts. It also will help motivate you as you can how you got stronger during the program. </dd>
        </dl>
        <dt>Form Over Weight</dt>
          <dd>It will not matter how much you lift if your form is bad. Focussing on form will help you become stronger and make your body less injury prone.</dd>
