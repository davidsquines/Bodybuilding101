        <p>Understanding how to train is one of the most fundamental skills to have as a bodybuilder. That all starts with having a good plan as your foundation. Before every workout phase I start, I like to plan out how the phase. For me, that plan contains two steps.

        <h3>Step 1: <u><em>Define your goals</em></u></h3>
        <p>It is useless to plan to a roadtrip if you dont plan a destination. When cooking a meal, you do not know what ingrediants you will need unless you specifically know what you are trying to cook. The same goes with planning your workouts. You will not know how to structure your workouts unles you know what goals you are trying to achieve. To figure out my goals, I like to ask myself questions related to what I want to achieve after my workouts.<br>Those questions include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do I want to gain or lose weight after my workout phase?</li>
          <li>Am I looking to build strength and mass or to build a better looking physique?</li>
          <li>What is going on with the current schedule in my life and how will it affect my goals in bodybuilding?</li>
